Repository for Predicting the Case Status of H1B
By studying the H-1B applications throughout passing years, I want to provide a prediction on the case stautus of H-1B visas. I hope the resulting model can serve as a guideline for international students who want to plan their career carefully in the U.S.The data I use for training is H-1B Visa Petitions 2011-2016 from Kaggle. This is a huge database that has roughly 3,000,000 observations. To address this classification question, I fit four models, which are KNN, logistic regression, elastic net, and random forest.
