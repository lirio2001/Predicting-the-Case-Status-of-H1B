1. my logistic regression doesn't work at all. No idea what's going on.

2. all the model perform poorly. How should I improve it? Possible  issue I am thinking about:
a. the difference between certified and certified-withdrawn is not clear (since it is the decision made by the company side, not immigration department)
b. problem occurs when randomly split the original data (not sure what's the correct function to use rather than sample() )
c. downsample ration = 3 is too high?
d. the range for tuning is not good

3. still working on conclusion! I wanna do it after I have a better model result.

4. graph took centuries to kint. Can I save and load them too?
